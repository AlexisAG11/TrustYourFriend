## What is it ?

An app that let you centralize all your favorite addresses (restaurants, bars, ...) and those of your friends. You can add friends, save addresses, and filter results by friend, city, or type of place.

## What Techno is used ?

I used **Angular** and pure html and css for the frontend.
For the backend I used **Express.js** with **MongoDB** for the database.
I also use **google API** and **AWS bucketS3**
